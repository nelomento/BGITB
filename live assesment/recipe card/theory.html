Frontend Development Course - Assessment

Section 1: Theory Questions

●	What is Bootstrap, and how does it facilitate frontend development? Explain its key features and advantages. Bootstrap is a giant collection of handy, reusable bits of code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s also a frontend development framework that enables developers and designers to quickly build fully responsive websites. Bootstrap implements responsive images through built-in code that automatically resizes them according to the current screen size.
Bootstrap’s pre-designed components, responsive grid system, and JavaScript plugins significantly accelerate the development process. Developers can quickly create professional-looking websites and web applications, reducing development time and effort.

Bootstrap provides a consistent and standardized design language. This uniformity in styling and layout across your project helps maintain a cohesive and professional appearance, even when multiple team members are working on different parts of the project.

Bootstrap has built-in support for various web browsers, ensuring that your website functions correctly and looks consistent across different browsers and versions. This eliminates the need for extensive browser-specific troubleshooting and fixes.

While Bootstrap offers a default set of styles and components, it’s highly customizable. You can tailor the framework to match your project’s unique branding and design requirements. This flexibility allows you to create distinct and visually appealing websites.

Bootstrap boasts a vast and active community of developers and designers. This means you can easily find tutorials, documentation, and third-party themes or extensions. You can also seek help and solutions from the community when encountering challenges.
●	Describe the grid system in Bootstrap. How can you create responsive layouts using the grid system?Bootstrap implements responsive images through built-in code that automatically resizes them according to the current screen size.
Grid System allows up to 12 columns across the page. You can use each of them individually or merge them together for wider columns. You can use all combinations of values summing up to 12. You can use 12 columns each of width 1, or use 4 columns each of width 3 or any other combination.
To make the grid responsive, there are five grid breakpoints, one for each responsive breakpoint: all breakpoints (extra small), small, medium, large, and extra large.


●	What are Bootstrap components? Provide examples of at least three commonly used Bootstrap components. Bootstrap components are reusable elements used as  building blocks that make up bootstrap framework.
Example
Nav- tabs, horizontal links
Button e.g btn- primary, btn-secondary 
Colouring e.g primary, secondary 
●	Explain the purpose and usage of the following JavaScript concepts: variables, functions, and loops.
Loops are sequences of cyclic instructions that allow us to repeat an action and do not stop until a condition is met. Loops help to minimize errors 
Variable is the ability of a program to store information in computer memory with the intention of reusing it later. Formally speaking, a variable is a name that refers to a value.
Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when “something” invokes it (calls it).
●	What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript? When would you use each of them?

Var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value.
Const creates “constant” variables that cannot be reassigned another value.
Var is function scoped when it is declared within a function, it can only be accessed within a function thereby restricting the user so it is better to use Let
Let is block scoped which means a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. Let can be updated not declared 
Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. Const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.

Const cannot be updated or re-declared
This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.
Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.
         While a const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects                  can be updated 

If you’re not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use const.


●	Discuss the importance of event handling in JavaScript. Provide an example of an event listener and how it responds to user actions.
Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions: Things that should be done every time a page loads. Things that should be done when the page is closed. Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button.

Event listeners are functions that are used to respond to specific events that occur in a web page, such as user clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs. They are a fundamental part of creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

In JavaScript, event listeners are added to HTML elements using the addEventListener() method. This method allows you to specify the type of event you want to listen for (e.g. “click”, “mousemove”, “keydown”), as well as the function that should be executed when the event occurs.
When an event is triggered, the browser executes the function associated with the event listener. This function can then perform any necessary actions in response to the event, such as updating the page content, changing the appearance of an element, or submitting a form.
●	How can you create and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript?
DOM manipulation in javascript is an important factor while creating a web application using HTML and JavaScript. It is the process of interacting with the DOM API to change or modify an HTML document that will be displayed in a web browser. This HTML document can be changed to add or remove elements, update existing elements, rearrange existing elements, etc.

By manipulating the DOM, we can create web applications that update the data in a web page without refreshing the page and can change its layout without doing a refresh. Throughout the document, items can be deleted, moved, or rearranged.
●	What is AJAX, and how does it facilitate asynchronous communication with the server in web development? 
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a combination of web application development technologies that make web applications more responsive to user interaction. Whenever your users interact with a web application, such as when they click buttons or checkmark boxes, the browser exchanges data with the remote server.
●	Describe the concept of callbacks in JavaScript and their role in handling asynchronous operations.
A callback function is a function in JavaScript that is called (or invoked) by the first function after the first function has completed its task. It’s a function that receives input from another function. Callbacks are often used when handling asynchronous events like network requests or file I/O.
●	Discuss the significance of responsive web design and why it's crucial in modern web development.
Responsive web design ensures that your website provides a seamless experience to users on any device, resulting in improved user engagement, increased reach, and better search engine visibility.

Coding question 
Create a Responsive Recipe Card with Modal
 

Task:
Create a responsive recipe card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The card should have a "View Details" button that opens a modal to display the full recipe.

Instructions:

Design a recipe card that includes the following elements:
●	Recipe name
●	Ingredients list (at least 3 items)
●	Preparation steps (at least 3 steps)
●	Cooking time
●	Difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Moderate, Difficult)

Use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style the recipe card and modal. Apply responsive design principles to make the card adjust well to different screen sizes.

Implement JavaScript functionality to handle the modal. When the "View Details" button is clicked, the modal should appear with the full recipe displayed.
